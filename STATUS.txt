Connected to our MongoDB collection.

Added a health check route.

Added a blog post route that posts new blog entry information. Used PostMan to test an entry! It's visible in our MongoDB collection, yay!

Added a route that returns all blog posts in our database! Encountered some setbacks when formatting but fixed it!
